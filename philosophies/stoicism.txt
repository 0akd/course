In a nutshell it tells - 

Some things are in our control and others not. Things in our control are opinion, pursuit, desire, aversion, and, in a word, whatever are our own actions. Things not in our control are body, property, reputation, command, and, in one word, whatever are not our own actions.
Wish the things which happen to be as they are, and you will have a tranquil flow of life. 

Learn to separate the things you can control from things you can not control.
Accept the things you can not control with serenity.
Demonstrate mastery over the things you can control.
Don't live in the past or future, but only in the fleeting moment.
Do not seek to have events happen as you want them to, but instead want them to happen as they do happen, and your life will go well.
