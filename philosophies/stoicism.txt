Living in agreement with nature: This means accepting the natural order of the universe and living in harmony with it through reason and virtue.

Four Cardinal Virtues:

Wisdom (Phronesis): Knowing what is good, bad, and indifferent; sound judgment and practical reasoning.

Courage (Andreia): Facing adversity bravely and persevering.

Justice (Dikaiosune): Treating others fairly, with kindness and respect.

Temperance (Sophrosune): Self-control, moderation, and discipline.

Distinction between what is within your control and what is not: Stoics focus on controlling their own thoughts, decisions, and actions, while accepting external events as outside their control.

Virtue is the only true good: External things like wealth, health, or pleasure are "indifferent" and only matter in how they relate to virtue.

Emotional resilience: Stoicism teaches managing destructive emotions by correcting errors in judgment and maintaining an attitude aligned with reason.

Ethical self-improvement: Regular reflection and practice of Stoic virtues lead to wisdom, tranquility, and a flourishing life.

Three-part system: Stoicism integrates

Logic (reasoning and clarity of thought),

Physics (understanding nature and the universe), and

Ethics (living virtuously).

Additional principles often highlighted include mindfulness of mortality, doing the right thing regardless of consequences, and seeing lifeâ€™s challenges as opportunities for growth
